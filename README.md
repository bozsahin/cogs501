COGS 501 - Algorithmic structures in cognition - METU 
-------------------------------------------------------

**Short description:** The course is an introduction to two foundational concepts in cognitive science: structural representation and computation. As empirical domain, we look at increasingly complex structural representations from morphology and syntax of natural languages. We couple this with an introduction to the theory of computation. We aim to establish that (i) human language capacity is (based on) a computationally describable unconscious system of rules and representations; (ii) that there are mathematically precise ways of talking about different *types* of structural relations; and (iii) that bringing these two together opens up new avenues in the cognitive scientific investigation of language.

### Evaluation

|Category| Date | Weight |
:---|:---|---:
Weekly quiz | Every week | 54% 
Midterm exam  | April 5, 2018, in class | 20%
Final exam | TBA | 26%

11 quizzes, sometimes in the beginning, sometimes at the end of class.

9 out of 11 counts toward overall grade.

### Attendance

More or less required, because of the quiz.

Past experience shows attendance is a robust
predictor of success in this course. Make-up quizzes are possible in case of a
medical issue.  

### Various

- Mobile phones and similar devices must be in silent mode and in bags during
  exams.
- Mobile phones are not good devices for taking notes. Pen are better for science notes. Writing is doing.
- METU ethical rules apply (check the official syllabus
  [here](https://odtusyllabus.metu.edu.tr/)).
