COGS 501 - Algorithmic structures in cognition - METU 
-------------------------------------------------------

non-COGS students: By departmental decision, this course is open to COGS students only. Sorry.

**Short description:** Introduction to three foundational concepts in cognitive science: representation of structure, its computation and uncertainty.

**Longer description** The mind appears to be one lean mean putting things together machine. What are put together? At least: structure, content
and uncertainty. This course is a somewhat gentle introduction to the mathematical aspects of these three topics. It is meant to bring incoming cogsci students up to speed
to be able to do research in a year or so.

**Lecturer** Cem Bozsahin (spring 2023)

**Teaching assistant:** Ecenur Cagirici

**Lectures** Wednesdays 14.40-17.30, in Room S03 of the Informatics Institute

We will start online. Then we will see how it goes.

In any case, I will have an open hour on Thursday 12.00-14.00, for face to face discussion for those who want it.
I will try to make it online as well, in case anybody wants to join online. 
In fairness to those who cannot make it face to face, I will try to record it to the best of abilities.


**News and discussion:** in class and the Google
[group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metu-cogs-501-algorithmic-structures-in-cognition)
of the course. 

**Quizzes:** Usually announced over email, to be done over the weekend, to be submitted in pdf/jpg. Solo and original work.

### Outline

- Structure (2 weeks)
- Automata and formal languages (4 weeks)
- Lambda calculus (4 weeks)

Michaelson, Greg (1989). An introduction to functional programming through lambda calculus (for lambda calculus)

de la Higuera, Colin (2010). Grammatical Inference. Cambridge University Press. (for probabilistic inference)
