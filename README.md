# Spring 2021

COGS 501 - Algorithmic structures in cognition - METU 
-------------------------------------------------------

**Short description:** Introduction to two foundational concepts in cognitive science: representation of structures and its computation. Mechanistic explanation of structure.

**Instructor:** Cem Bozsahin (spring 2021)

 This term the course is going to be online. I will send you video and Q&A links.

**Teaching assistant:** Ecenur Cagirici

**News and discussion:** in class and the Google
[group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metu-cogs-501-algorithmic-structures-in-cognition)
of the course. 

**Time and place:** Live Q&A is on Thursdays 14.40. Lectures are up in youtube, for which I send links every monday, to read before Q&A.

**Quizzes:** Usually announced after live Q&A, to be done over the weekend, to be submitted in pdf/jpg. Solo and original work.

### Outline

- Structure (2 weeks)
- Automata and formal languages (4 weeks)
- Lambda calculus (4 weeks)
- Probabilistic inference from structures (3 weeks)
- Mid-term exam (1 week)


### Material

Lecture notes are <a href="https://github.com/umutozge/cogs501">here</a>.

Course material is an odd mixture of:

Sudkamp, Thomas (1997). Formal Languages and Machines. Pearson. 2nd edition. (for automata and formal languages)

Michaelson, Greg (1989). An introduction to functional programming through lambda calculus (for lambda calculus)

de la Higuera, Colin (2010). Grammatical Inference. Cambridge University Press. (for probabilistic inference)




### Evaluation
