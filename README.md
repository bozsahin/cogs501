COGS 501 - Algorithmic structures in cognition - METU 
-------------------------------------------------------

**Short description:** Introduction to three foundational concepts in cognitive science: representation of structure, its computation and uncertainty. 

**Lecturer** Cem Bozsahin (spring 2022)

**Lectures** Wednesdays 14.40-17.30, in Room S03 of the Informatics Institute

The course will be face to face. I record the lectures and show videos during lectures, also recorded.
Physical attendance is not required. But mental attendance, physical or online, is always required.

At any rate, we cannot exceed the physical attendance limit of 16 students in class at any time, as determined
by the university for the pandemic size of the room.

**Teaching assistant:** TBA

**News and discussion:** in class and the Google
[group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metu-cogs-501-algorithmic-structures-in-cognition)
of the course. 

**Quizzes:** Usually announced over email, to be done over the weekend, to be submitted in pdf/jpg. Solo and original work.

### Outline

- Structure (2 weeks)
- Automata and formal languages (4 weeks)
- Lambda calculus (4 weeks)
- Probabilistic inference from structures (3 weeks)
- Mid-term exam (1 week)

Michaelson, Greg (1989). An introduction to functional programming through lambda calculus (for lambda calculus)

de la Higuera, Colin (2010). Grammatical Inference. Cambridge University Press. (for probabilistic inference)
