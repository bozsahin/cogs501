### Outline

- [From Aristotle to Ibn Khaldun, Kepler, Hume, Marr and Turing] Mechanistic explanation. (2 weeks)
- [Automata and formal languages] (4 weeks)
- [Lambda calculus] (4 weeks)

### Material

Lecture notes are <a href="https://github.com/umutozge/cogs501">here</a>.

Course material is an odd mixture of:

Sudkamp, Thomas (1997). Formal Languages and Machines. Pearson. 2nd edition. (for automata and formal languages)

Michaelson, Greg (1989). An introduction to functional programming through lambda calculus (for lambda calculus)

de la Higuera, Colin (2010). Grammatical Inference. Cambridge University Press. (for probabilistic inference)




### Evaluation

|Category| Date | Weight |
:---|:---|---:
Weekly quiz | Every week | 54% 
Midterm exam  | TBA | 20%
Final exam | TBA | 26%

11 quizzes, sometimes in the beginning, sometimes at the end of class.

9 out of 11 count toward overall grade.
